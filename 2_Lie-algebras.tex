\section{Lie algebras}





A \emph{Lie algebra} is a linear object whose representation theory is (in 
principle) manageable. To any linear algebraic group $G$ we will associate a 
Lie algebra $\fg=\lie(G)$, and study the representation theory of $G$ via that 
of $\fg$. 





\subsection{Definition and first properties}

Fix a field $k$. Eventually we'll avoid characteristic $2$, and some theorems 
will only be valid in characteristic zero. 

\begin{definition}
A \emph{Lie algebra} over $k$ is a $k$-vector space $\fg$ equipped with a map 
$[\cdot,\cdot]:\fg\times \fg\to \fg$ such that the following hold:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $[\cdot,\cdot]$ is bilinear (it factors through $\fg\otimes\fg$). 
  \item $[x,x]=0$ for all $x\in \fg$ ($[\cdot,\cdot]$ factors through 
    $\bigwedge^2 \fg$).
  \item The Jacobi identity $[x,[y,z]]+[y,[z,x]]+[z,[x,y]]=0$ holds for all 
    $x,y,z\in \fg$.  
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

We could have defined a Lie algebra over $k$ as being a $k$-vector space 
$\fg$ together with $[\cdot,\cdot]:\bigwedge^2 \fg\to \fg$ satisfying the 
Jacobi identity. We call $[\cdot,\cdot]$ the \emph{Lie bracket}. 

The Lie bracket satisfies a number of basic properties. For example, 
$[x,y]=-[y,x]$ because 
\begin{align*}
  0 &= [x+y,x+y] && \text{(alternating)} \\
    &= [x,x]+[x,y]+[y,x]+[y,y] && \text{(bilinear)} \\
    &= [x,y] + [y,x] . && \text{(alternating)}
\end{align*}
Later on, we'll use an alternate form of the Jacobi identity: 
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:jac-ident}\tag{$*$}
  [x,[y,z]]-[y,[x,z]] = [[x,y],z] .
\end{equation*}





\subsection{The main examples}

\begin{example}
Let $V$ be any $k$-vector space. Then the zero map $\bigwedge^2 V\to V$ 
trivially satisfies the Jacobi identity. We call any Lie algebra whose 
bracket is identically zero \emph{commutative} (or \emph{abelian}). 
\end{example}

\begin{example}[General linear]
Again, let $V$ be a $k$-vector space. The Lie algebra $\gl(V)=\End_k(V)$ as a 
$k$-vector space, with bracket $[X,Y]=X\circ Y-Y\circ X$. It is a good exercise 
(which everyone should do at least once in their life) to check that this 
actually is Lie algebra. When $V=k^n$, we write $\gl_n(k)$ instead of 
$\gl(k^n)$. 
\end{example}

Often, we will just write $\gl_n$ instead of $\gl_n(k)$. We will also do this 
for the other named Lie algebras. 

\begin{example}[Special linear]
Put $\Sl_n(k)=\{X\in \gl_n(k):\trace X=0\}$. Since $\trace [X,Y]=0$, this is a 
Lie subalgebra of $\gl_n$. In fact, $[\gl_n,\gl_n]\subset \Sl_n$. 
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Special orthogonal]
Put $\so_n(k) = \{X\in \gl_n(k):\transpose X=-X\}$. This is a Lie subalgebra 
of $\gl_n(k)$ because if $X,Y\in \so_n(k)$, then 
\begin{align*}
  \transpose{[X,Y]} 
    &= \transpose Y \transpose X-\transpose X \transpose Y \\
    &= (-Y)(-X) - (-X)(-Y) \\
    &= -[X,Y] .
\end{align*}
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Symplectic]
Let $J_n=\begin{pmatrix} & -I_n \\ I_n \end{pmatrix}\in \gl_{2n}(k)$. Put 
\[
  \fsp_{2n}(k) = \{X\in \gl_{2n}(k):J X+\transpose X\cdot J=0\} .
\]
As an exercise, check that this is a Lie subalgebra of $\gl_{2n}$. 
\end{example}

As an exercise, show that $\dR^3$ with the bracket $[u,v]=u\times v$ (cross 
product) is a Lie algebra over $\dR$. 

\begin{theorem}[Ado]
Any finite dimensional Lie algebra over $k$ is isomorphic to a Lie subalgebra 
of some $\gl_n(k)$. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
In characteristic zero, this is in \cite[I \S 7.3]{bourbaki-lie-alg-1-3}. The 
positive-characteristic case is dealt with in \cite[VI \S3]{jacobson-1979}.
\end{proof}

Another good exercise is to realize $\dR^3$ with bracket $[u,v]=u\times v$ as 
a subalgebra of some $\gl_n(\dR)$. 





\subsection{Homomorphisms and the adjoint representation}

\begin{definition}
A \emph{homomorphism} of Lie algebras $\varphi:\fg\to \fh$ is a $k$-linear map 
such that $\varphi([x,y])=[\varphi x,\varphi y]$. 
\end{definition}

If $\varphi:\fg\to \fh$ is a homomorphism of Lie algebras, then 
$\fa=\ker(\varphi)$ is a Lie subalgebra of $\fg$. This is easy: 
\begin{align*}
  \varphi[x,y]
    &= [\varphi(x),\varphi(y)] \\
    &= [0,0] \\
    &= 0 .
\end{align*}

\begin{definition}
A Lie subalgebra $\fa$ of $\fg$ is an \emph{ideal} if 
$[\fa,\fg]\subset \fa$, i.e.~$[a,x]\in \fa$ for all $a\in \fa$, $x\in \fg$. 
\end{definition}

Equivalently, $\fa\subset \fg$ is an ideal if $[\fg,\fa]\subset \fa$. If 
$\fa\subset \fg$ is an ideal, we define the \emph{quotient algebra} $\fg/\fa$ 
to be $\fg/\fa$ as a vector space, with bracket induced by that of $\fg$. So 
\[
  [x+\fa,y+\fa] = [x,y]+\fa .
\]
Let's check that this makes sense. If $a_1,a_2\in \fa$, then 
\begin{align*}
  [x+a_1,x+a_2] 
    &= [x,y] + [x,a_2]+[a_1,y]+[a_1,a_2] \\
    &\equiv [x,y] \pmod \fa .
\end{align*}

If $\varphi:\fg\to \fh$ is a Lie homomorphism, then we get an induced 
isomorphism  $\fg/\ker(\varphi)\iso \image(\varphi)\subset \fh$. 

\begin{example}
Give $k$ the trivial Lie bracket. Then $\trace:\gl_n(k) \to k$ is a a 
homomorphism. Indeed, 
\[
  \trace [X,Y]=\trace(X Y)-\trace(Y X)= 0 .
\]
We could have defined $\Sl_n(k)=\ker(\trace)$; this is an ideal in 
$\gl_n$, and $\gl_n(k)/\Sl_n(k)\iso k$. 
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
Let $\fg$ be a Lie algebra over $k$. The \emph{adjoint representation} of $\fg$ 
is the map $\adjoint:\fg\to \gl(\fg)$ defined by $\adjoint(x)(y) = [x,y]$ for 
$x,y\in \fg$. 
\end{definition}

It is easy to check that $\adjoint:\fg\to \gl(\fg)$ is $k$-linear, that is 
$\adjoint(c x)=c\adjoint(x)$ and $\adjoint(x+y)=\adjoint(x)+\adjoint(y)$. 
It is bit less obvious how the adjoint action behaves with respect to 
the Lie bracket. We compute 
\begin{align*}
  \adjoint([x,y])(z) 
    &= [[x,y],z] \\
    &=_\eqref{eq:jac-ident} [x,[y,z]]-[y,[x,z]] \\
    &= (\adjoint(x) \adjoint(y))(z) - (\adjoint(y)\adjoint(x))(z) .
\end{align*}
Thus $\adjoint[x,y] = [\adjoint(x),\adjoint(y)]$ and we have shown that 
$\adjoint:\fg\to \gl(\fg)$ is a homomorphism of Lie algebras. If 
$n=\dim_k(\fg)<\infty$, then $\adjoint:\fg\to \gl(\fg)\simeq \gl_n(k)$ is 
an interesting finite-dimensional representation of $\fg$. If 
$\dim(\fg)>1$, it cannot be surjective, and there are easy ways for it to 
fail to be injective. 

\begin{definition}
Let $\fg$ be a Lie algebra over $k$. The \emph{center} of $\fg$ is 
\[
  \zentrum(\fg) = \{x\in \fg:[x,y]=0\text{ for all }y\in \fg\} .
\]
\end{definition}

Note that $\zentrum(\fg)=\ker(\adjoint)$. There is a natural injection 
$\fg/\zentrum(\fg)\monic \gl(\fg)$. 

\begin{definition}
A Lie algebra $\fg$ is \emph{simple} if it is non-commutative, and has no 
ideals except $0$ and $\fg$. 
\end{definition}

Just as with simple algebraic groups, there is a classification theorem for 
simple Lie algebras. Even better, since Lie algebras are more ``rigid'' than 
algebraic groups, we don't have to worry about isogeny. 

\begin{theorem}
Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Up to 
isomorphism, every Lie algebra is a member of the following list: 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c}
$\typeA_n$ ($n\geqslant 1$) & $\Sl_{n+1}$ \\
$\typeB_n$ ($n\geqslant 2$) & $\so_{2n+1}$ \\
$\typeC_n$ ($n\geqslant 3$) & $\fsp_{2n}$ \\
$\typeD_n$ ($n\geqslant 4$)  & $\so_{2n}$ \\
exceptional & $\fe_6$, $\fe_7$, $\fe_8$, $\ff_4$, $\fg_2$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{theorem}

The classification theorem for algebraic groups is proved via the 
classification theorem for Lie algebras, which ends up being a matter of 
combinatorics. 





\subsection{Lie algebra of an algebraic group}

For the sake of clarity, we give a scheme-theoretic definition of algebraic 
groups:

\begin{definition}
Let $S$ be a scheme. An \emph{algebraic group} over $S$ is an affine group 
scheme of finite type over $S$. 
\end{definition}

For the moment, we will say that an algebraic group $G$ over $S$ is 
\emph{linear} if $G$ is a subgroup scheme of $\GL(\sL)$ for some locally 
free sheaf $\sL$ on $S$. 

Fix a field $k$, and let $G\subset \GL(n)_{/k}$ be a linear algebraic group cut 
out by polynomials $f_1,\dots,f_r$. For any $k$-algebra $R$, we define
\[
  G(R) = \{g\in \GL_n(R):f_1(g)=\cdots = f_r(g)=0\} .
\]
This is a functor $\algebras k\to \sets$. Since $G$ is a subgroup scheme of 
$\GL(n)_{/k}$, the set $G(R)$ inherits the group structure from $\GL_n(R)$. 
So we will think of $G$ as a functor $G:\algebras k \to \groups$. By the Yoneda 
Lemma, the variety $G$ is determined by its functor of points 
$G:\algebras k\to \sets$. 

We are especially interested in the $k$-algebra of \emph{dual numbers}, 
$k[\varepsilon]=k[x]/x^2$. Informally, $\varepsilon$ should be thought of as a 
``infinitesimal quantity'' in the style of Newton and Leibniz. The scheme 
$\spectrum(k[\varepsilon])$ should be thought of as a ``point together with 
a direction.'' 

\begin{hard}
For the moment, let $k$ be an arbitrary base ring, $X_{/k}$ a scheme. We define 
the \emph{$n$-Jet space} of $X$ to be the scheme $\jet_n X$ whose functor of 
points is $(\jet_n X)(A) = X(A[t]/t^{n+1})$. By \cite{vojta-2007}, this 
functor is representable, so $\jet_n X$ is actually a scheme. The first jet 
space $\jet_1 X$ is called the \emph{tangent space} of $X$, and denoted 
$\tangent X$. The maps $A[t]/t^{n+1}\epic A[t]/t^n$ induce projections 
$\jet_{n+1} X\to \jet_n X$. In particular, the tangent space of $X$ comes with 
a canonical projection $\pi:\tangent X\to X$. 
\end{hard}

Consider $G(k[\varepsilon])$. As a set, this consists of invertible $n\times n$ 
matrices with entries in $k[\varepsilon]$ on which the $f_i$ vanish. The map 
$\varepsilon\mapsto 0$ from $k[\varepsilon]\to k$ induces a group homomorphism 
$\pi:G(k[\varepsilon])\to G(k)$. We will consider this map as the ``tangent 
space'' of $G(k)$. For each $g\in G(k)$, the fiber 
$\pi^{-1}(g)$ is the ``tangent space of $G$ at $g$.'' 

Note that 
\[
  \pi^{-1}(g) = \{g+\varepsilon v:v\in \matrices_n(k):f_i(g+\varepsilon v)=0\text{ for all }i\} .
\]
For each $s$, the polynomial $f_s$ has a Taylor series expansion 
\[
  f_s(x_{i j}) = f_s(g) + \sum_{i,j} \frac{\partial f_s}{\partial x_{i,j}}(g) (x_{i,j}-g_{i,j}) .
\]
Since $f_s(g)=0$, we get 
$f_s(g+\varepsilon v) = \varepsilon \sum_{i,j} \frac{\partial f_s}{\partial x_{i,j}}(g) v_{i,j}$. 
It follows that 
\[
  \pi^{-1}(g) = \left\{g+\varepsilon v:v\in \matrices_n(k):\sum_{i,j} \frac{\partial f_s}{\partial x_{i j}}(g) v_{i j}=0\text{ for all }1\leqslant s\leqslant r\right\} .
\]
We will be especially interested in $\fg=\pi^{-1}(1)$. We will turn this into a 
Lie algebra using the group structure on $G$. 

\begin{hard}
From the scheme-theoretic perspective, the identity element $1\in G(k)$ comes 
from a section $e:\spectrum(k)\to G$ of the structure $G\to \spectrum(k)$. The 
\emph{scheme-theoretic Lie algebra} of $G$ is the fiber product 
\[
  \fg = e^\ast 1 = \tangent(G)\times_G \spectrum(k) .
\]
By definition, $\fg(A)=\ker\left(G(A[\varepsilon])\to G(A)\right)$ for any 
$k$-algebra $A$. Just as with algebraic groups, we will write $\fg_{/k}$ for 
$\fg$ thought of as a group scheme 
over $k$, and just $\fg$ for the $\fg(k)$. 
\end{hard}





\subsection{Functors of points}

Recall that schemes can be thought of as functors $\algebras k\to \sets$. For 
example, affine $n$-space is the functor $\dA^n(A)=A^n$. In fact, this is an 
algebraic group, the operation coming from addition on $A$. Moreover, $\dA^n$ 
is \emph{representable} in the sense that 
\[
  \dA^n(A) = \hom_k(k[x_1,\dots,x_n],A) ,
\]
via $(a_1,\dots,a_n)\mapsto (x_i\mapsto a_i)$. Similarly, 
$\SL(n)_{/k}$ sends a $k$-algebra $A$ to $\SL_n(A)$. It is represented by the 
ring $k[x_{i j}]/(\det(x)-1)$. In general, we take some polynomials 
$f_1,\dots,f_r\in k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$, and consider the subscheme 
$X=V(f_1,\dots,f_r)\subset \dA^n$ which represents the functor 
\[
  X(A) = \{a\in A^n:f_1(a)=\cdots = f_r(a)=0\} .
\]
This has coordinate ring $k[x_1,\dots,x_n]/(f_1,\dots,f_r)$. Note that 
\emph{any} finitely generated $k$-algebras is of this form. In other words, all 
affine schemes of finite type over $k$ are subschemes of some affine space. 

Clasically, one gives $X(\bar k)$ the \emph{Zariski topology}. If 
$f\in k[X]=\dA^1(X)$, we get (by definition) a function 
$f:X(\bar k)\to \bar k$. We define open subsets of $X(\bar k)$ to be 
those of the form $\{x\in X(\bar k):f(x)\ne 0\}$. More scheme-theoretically, 
we say that an \emph{open subscheme} of $X$ is the complement of any 
$V(f)$ for $f\in k[X]$. 

\begin{hard}
We can think of the Zariski topology as giving a Grothendieck topology on the 
category of affine schemes over $k$. It is subcanonical, i.e.~all representable 
functors are sheaves. So if we formally put $\affine k = (\algebras k)^\circ$, 
then the category of schemes over $k$ embeds into 
$\sheaves_\zariski(\affine k)$. When working with algebraic groups, often it is 
better with the \'etale or fppf topologies. In particular, we will think of 
quotients as living in $\sheaves_\fppf(\affine k)$. 
\end{hard}

\begin{definition}
Let $k$ be a feld. A \emph{variety} over $k$ is a reduced separated scheme of 
finite type over $k$. 
\end{definition}

In particular, an affine variety is determined by a reduced $k$-algebra. We 
can directly associate a ``geometric object'' to a $k$-algebra $A$, namely its 
\emph{spectrum} $\spectrum(A)=\{\fp\subset A\text{ prime ideal}\}$. Finally, we 
note that if $X=\spectrum(A)$ is of finite type over $k$ and if $k=\bar k$, then 
$X(k)=\hom_k(A,k)$ is the set of maximal ideas in $A$. 





\subsection{Affine group schemes and Hopf algebras}

A affine group $G_{/k}$ will give us a functor $G:\algebras k\to \groups$. As 
such, it should have morphisms 
\begin{align*}
  m :G\times G &\to G && \text{``multiplication''} \\
  e:1=\spectrum(k) &\to G && \text{``identity''} \\
  i:G &\to G && \text{``inverse''}
\end{align*}
These correspond to ring homomorphisms 
\begin{align*}
  \Delta:A &\to A\otimes_k A && \text{``comultiplication''} \\
  \varepsilon : A &\to k && \text{``counit''} \\
  \sigma:A &\to A && \text{``coinverse''}
\end{align*}
Obviously the maps on groups satisfy some axioms like associativity etc. These 
can be phrased by the commutativity of diagrams like 
\[\begin{tikzcd}
  G\times G\times G \ar[r, "\id\times m"] \ar[d, "m\times \id"] 
    & G\times G \ar[d, "m"] \\ 
  G\times G \ar[r, "m"] 
    & G .
\end{tikzcd}\]
Most sources do not give all these diagrams explicitly. One that does is 
the book \cite{waterhouse-1979}. 

It is a good exercise to show that we have the following maps for the additive 
and multiplicative groups:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|cccc}
group & ring & comultiplication & coident. & coinverse \\ \hline
$\Ga$ & $k[x]$ & $x\mapsto x\otimes 1+1\otimes x$ & $x\mapsto 0$ & $x\mapsto -x$ \\
$\Gm$ & $k[x^{\pm 1}]$ & $x\mapsto x\otimes x$ & $x\mapsto 1$ & $x\mapsto x^{-1}$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The analogue of associativity for coordinate rings and comultiplication is the 
commutativity of the following diagram:
\[\begin{tikzcd}
  A \ar[r, "\Delta"] \ar[d, "\Delta"] 
    & A\otimes_k A \ar[d, "\id\otimes \Delta"] \\
  A\otimes_k A \ar[r, "\Delta\otimes \id"] 
    & A\otimes_k A\otimes_k A
\end{tikzcd}\]
The tuple $(A,\Delta,\varepsilon,\sigma)$ is called a \emph{Hopf algebra}. In 
principle, all theorems about algebraic groups can be rephrased as theorems 
about Hopf algebras, but this is not very illuminating. The one advantage is 
that it is possible to speak of Hopf algebras for which the ring $A$ is 
\emph{not} commutative. These show up in algebraic number theory, combinatorics, 
and physics. 

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:groups-linear}
If $G$ is an affine group scheme of finite type over $k$, then it is a 
linear algebraic group over $k$. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
This is \cite[6b.11.11]{sga3-i}. Essentially, one looks at the action of $G$ 
on the (possibly infinite-dimensional) vector space $k[G]$. A general theorem 
yields a faithful finite-dimensional representation $V$, and we get $G$ as a 
subgroup-scheme of $\GL(V)$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{hard}
If $S$ is a dedekind scheme (noetherian, one-dimensional, regular) and $G_{/S}$ 
is a affine flat separated group scheme of finite type over $S$, then the 
obvious generalization of autoref{thm:groups-linear} holds for $G$; it is a 
closed subgroup of $\GL(\sL)$ for $\sL$ a locally free sheaf on $S$ 
\cite[6b.11.11.1]{sga3-i}. 
Interestingly, this fails for more general base schemes. 
\end{hard}





\subsection{Examples of group schemes}

So all group varieties over $k$ embed into $\GL(n)_{/k}$ \emph{as an algebraic 
group}. We can think of an algebraic group in several ways: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item As a group-valued functor on $\algebras k$. 
  \item As a commutative Hopf algebra over $k$. 
  \item As a subgroup of $\GL_n(k)$ cut out by poynomials. 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{example}
The group of \emph{$n$-th roots of unity} is $\dmu_n$. Its coordinate ring is 
$k[x]/(x^n-1)$. So 
\[
  \dmu_n(A) = \{a\in A:a^n=1\} ,
\]
with the group operation coming from multiplication in $A$. Note that 
$\dmu_n\subset \Gm$. If the base field $k$ has characteristic 
$p\nmid n$, then $\dmu_n(\bar k)$ is a cyclic group of order $n$. However, if 
$n=p$, then $x^p-1=(x-1)^p$. So the coordinate ring 
$k[x]/((x-1)^p)$ is non-reduced. This is our first example of a group scheme 
that is \emph{not} a group variety. One realization of this is that 
$\dmu_p(\overline{\dF_p})=1$. These problems can only occur in characteristic 
$p>0$. If $G$ is a group scheme over a characteristic zero field, then 
$G$ is automatically reduced. 

Let $\phi:\Gm\to \Gm$ be the homomorphism $x\mapsto x^p$. Note that 
$\ker(\phi)=\dmu_p$. On $\overline{\dF_p}$-points, this map is an isomorphism, 
but $\phi$ is \emph{not} an isomorphism of algebraic groups. 
\end{example}

Let $G_{/k}$ be a linear algebraic group. Recall that we defined the \emph{Lie 
algebra} $\fg=\lie(G)$ of $G$ to be the functor on $k$-algebras given by 
\[
  \fg(A) = \ker\left(G(A[\varepsilon]/\varepsilon^2) \to G(A)\right) .
\]
In [reference here] we saw that if $G\subset \GL(n)_{/k}$ is cut out by 
$f_1,\dots,f_r$, then the $k$-valued points could be computed as 
\[
  \fg = \left\{B\in \matrices_n(k):\sum_{i,j} \frac{\partial f_\alpha}{\partial x_{i j}}(1_n)\cdot B_{i j}=0\right\} .
\]

\begin{example}[Special linear]
Let $G=\SL(n)_{/k}$. Note that $G\subset \GL(n)$ is cut out by $\det=1$. So 
$\fg=\lie(G)=\Sl_n$ is 
\[
  \Sl_n = \left\{1+B\varepsilon:B\in \matrices_n(k)\text{ and }\det(1+B\varepsilon)=1\right\} .
\]
The expansion of determinant is 
$\det(1+B\varepsilon)=1+\trace(B)\varepsilon + O(\varepsilon^2)$. Thus 
\[
  \Sl_n = \left\{B\in \matrices_n(k):\trace(B)=0\right\} .
\]
As a functor, $\Sl_n(A)=\{A\in \matrices_n(A):\trace A=0\}$. 
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Orthogonal]
Recall that $G=\Or(n)\subset \GL(n)$ is cut out by $A \transpose A=1$. So 
\begin{align*}
  \fg
    &= \{1+B\varepsilon  (1+B\varepsilon) \transpose{(1+B\varepsilon)}=1\} \\
    &= \{1+B\varepsilon:B+\transpose B=0\} \\
    &\simeq \{B\in \matrices_n(k):\transpose B=-B\} \\
    &= \so_n(k) .
\end{align*}
If the characteristic of $k$ is not $2$, then $\dim(\so_n)=n(n-1)/2$. 
\end{example}
